# AWS Setup Guide 
1. Launch an EC2 Instance
   1. Create an ubuntu instance on Research Gateway
   2. Select instance type: `t3.medium` (or higher)
2. Install git 
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y git python3-pip 
```
3. Clone the billiegene repository
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/monjojane/billiegene.git  
```
4. `cd` into billiegene
```bash
cd billiegene
```

# Prerequisites

## System Requirements 
- AWS Ubuntu EC2 instance (tested on t3.medium or higher)
- Python 3.8+

## Dependencies 
Ensure that you are in the project directory `billiegene`, else naviate to that directory using this command:
```bash
cd billiegene
```

Install all necessary Python packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Alternatively, create a virtual environment:
<pre>python3 -m venv myenv  
source myenv/bin/activate  
pip install -r requirements.txt</pre>

After installation, you can verify the packages were installed successfully:
```bash
pip list
```

# How to run the method on AWS

To run/test the scripts, ensure you have done the AWS setup guide and installed all necessary dependencies as mentioned above. 

Then follow these step-by-step instructions:

## Data parsing
Use `data_parsing.py` to parse your raw json data into a readable csv format.
Ensure that the raw json file is in the `data` folder.

A test data set is available for you to test the script. To run the script with the test data set:

**Step 1:** `cd` into the `data` folder.

**Step 2:**  Ensure that the dataset you would like to parse is correctly stated in the script `data_parsing.py`.

**Step 3:** Run `data_parsing.py`.

```bash 
python3 data_parsing.py
```

**Step 4:** Use `ls` to check that the parsed csv file is created and in the data folder.

## Training the model
The trained model is already saved in the `models` folder as `model.pkl` and you do not have to run the script to train it. However, the script is available under `models` folder as `model_training.py` for your information. 

## Making predictions
Use `prediction.py` to make predictions. This script loads the saved trained model and uses it to make predictions on a set of data you input.

**Step 1:** Ensure the dataset (parsed csv file) you wish to make predictions on is in the `data` folder.

**Step 2:** `cd` into the `predictions` folder.

**Step 3:** Run `prediction.py`.

```bash
python3 prediction.py
```

**Step 6:** Use `ls` to check that the prediction csv file is created and in the predictions folder.

**Step 7:** To view the first few rows of the predictions csv file
```bash
head < name of predictions csv file >
```

# Example Usage
If you wish to skip the data parsing step as well, we already have a dataset ready (`example_parsed_data.csv`) to make predictions on. This dataset has been parsed and aggregated using our scripts. 

All you have to do is to `cd` into `prediction` folder and run the `example_prediction.py` file to generate the results without having to edit the script.

```bash
python3 example_prediction.py
```

Here is an example of how the predictions should look like:

# Issues
- Instance Limitations:
  Low-memory instances may encounter issues (e.g. insufficient memory, runtime error) during model training. Consider using larger instance types if faced with these issues.
